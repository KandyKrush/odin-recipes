    <h1>Chana Masala!</h1>
    <img src="chana-masala.jpg" alt="Tasty Indian Chana Masala">
    <p>Chana Masala is a staple Indian dish, particularly in the Punjab region.
        It features chickpeas, onions, green chili, tomatos, and Indian spices.
        I definitely enjoy spicy stuff over sweet food, and this is just one example of that.

    <p>The directions for making this dish are:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Grind onion, tomato, ginger, garlic, and chili pepper together in a food processor into a paste.</li>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Fry bay leaves in hot oil until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Pour the paste into the skillet and cook until the oil begins to separate from the mixture and is golden brown in color, 2 to 3 minutes. Season the mixture with chili powder, coriander, gram masala, turmeric, and salt; cook and stir until very hot, 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir just enough water into the mixture to get a thick sauce; bring to a boil and stir chickpeas into the sauce. Reduce heat to medium and cook until the chickpeas are heated through, 5 to 7 minutes. Garnish with cilantro.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>And there you have it! Fresh chana masala! Enjoy!</p>
